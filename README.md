Course work, which investigates finding the chromatic number in all small graphs.

Program read all graphs from graph*.txt files and computes a chromatic number for each graph. Time is measured for each algorithm. Also you can see the full output of graph color in relevant txt files.

You can see log by running a program on your PC. Entry point is src/Solution.java.
