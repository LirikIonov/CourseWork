Course work, which is investigated finding the chromatic number in all small graphs.

Entry point is src/Solution.java.

Program read all graphs from graph*.txt files and computes a chromatic number for each graph. Time is measured for each algorithm. Also you can see the full output of graph color in relevant txt files.
